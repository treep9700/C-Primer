A switchman sat in a small shack on one side of the river where he operated the controls
 to turn the bridge and lock it into place as the train crossed. One evening as the switchman 
was waiting for the last train of the day to come, he looked off into the distance thru the 
dimming twilight and caught sight of the trainlights. He stepped to the control and waited 
until the train was within a prescribed distance when he was to turn the bridge. He turned 
the bridge into position, but, to his horror, he found the locking control did not work. If the 
bridge was not securely in position it would wobble back and forth at the ends when the train 
came onto it, causing the train to jump the track and go crashing into the river. This would 
be a passenger train with many people aboard. He left the bridge turned across the river, and
 hurried across the bridge to the other side of the river wher He would have to hold the lever 
back firmly as the train crossed. He could hear the rumble of the train now, and he took hold 
of the lever and leaned backward to apply his weight to it, locking the bridge. He kept applying 
the pressure to keep the mechanism locked. Many lives depended on this man's strength.
